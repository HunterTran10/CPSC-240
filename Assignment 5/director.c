//Program name: Triangle Area Calculator
//Programming languages: One module in C, two in X86, and one in bash.
//Date program began: 2024-Apr-25
//Date of last update: 2024-May-11
//Files in this program: director.c, producer.asm, sin.asm, r.sh.  
//Testing: Alpha testing completed.  All functions are correct.

//Purpose of this program:
//  This program takes in user inputted values of the lengths of two sides of a triangle and the degrees of the angle between those 
//  two sides. It then computes the area of a triangle.

//This file
